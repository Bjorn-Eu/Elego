Elego is program that plays capture go, a simplified version of go often used as an introduction for beginners. It is written as a first project to learn about deep learning using PyTorch. 

We highly recommend the book "Deep learning and the game of go" by Pumperla and Ferguson which we found useful while creating this project.
